# Working with APIs
#### Self contained program that generates a visualization based on the data that it retrieves.
* A program to automatically download information about the most starred python projects on GitHub & then creates  an informative visualization of these projects.
* Web application Programming Interface that requests specific information from a website rather than entire pages and then use that information to generate visualization
* The program uses current data and its always up to date

## Git & Github
The visualization is based on information from github," a site that allows programmers to collaborate on coding projects.
1. Use GitHub's API to request information about python projects on the site & then generate an interactive visualization of the relative popularity of these projects using Plotly.

## Steps
#### Using the web API
1. Requesting data using an API call
2. Installing Requests
3. Processing an API response
4. Working with the response dictionary
5. Summarizing the top repositories
6. Monitoring API limits
#### Visualization repositories using plotly
1. Refining ploty charts
2. Adding custome tooltips
3. Adding clickable links to the graph
4. Plotly & Github API
